# In this repository is code that runs a website that summarizes my programming experience these past few years. Included is a simple visualization using D3.JS that plots the results of a query to INSPIRE HEP. This application is built with NodeJS and uses webpack and Grunt for compiling and bundling up js and css. In addition I use RequireJS to improve the speed and quality of the code.

## To run this application clone the repo and type in the command line node app.js, of course you will need NodeJS and NPM to be installed beforehand.
